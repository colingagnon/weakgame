#### About this repository
This repository was originally created to be used in a "hack day" for a project management class.  The students are given 1 working day to try and complete some of the additional features. At this point this is super rough, mostly intentionally, but I could see it being developed as a way to test skills for the interview process, or as a rather tool for current employees.
